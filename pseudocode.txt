1.  Filter input files and potential format errors

2.  Define a structure (struct) to represent our tables data type

3.  Create our binary tables, TBL24 with 2^24 entries and TBLlong with 2^8 entries (expandable by N)

4.  Read from "route_table.txt" and obtain the prefix and output interface. We will insert the entries
    recovered into their corresponding slots in the tables. If the mask is lower than 24bits we will insert it
    in TBL24, if longer into TBLlong


5.  In a loop:
        a. Read from "pruebaX.txt" and obain the IP adressess

        b. Search for the Longest Prefix Match inside our tables and figure out the output interface
                i. Check for default interface, return interface
                ii. Check in TBL24 (first table) if our 1st bit of the output interface is 0, return interface
                iii. Else check in TBLlong (second table) and figure out our position, return interface

7.  Free the memory for IO and our tables
