1.  Define a struct to represent each node in the binary search tree

2.  Define a function to insert a node into the binary search tree
        a. If the tree is empty, create a new node with the given prefix and subnet and set it as the root
        b. Otherwise, traverse the tree and insert the node as a child of the appropriate parent node

3.  Define a function to search for the best route for a given IP address
        a. Convert the IP address to binary form
        b. Traverse the binary search tree and compare the prefix of each node to the subnet of the given IP address
        c. Keep track of the longest matching prefix found so far
        d. Return the prefix with the longest match as the best route

4.  Define a function to convert a decimal number to a binary string
    In the main function:
        a. Create a binary search tree with some example routes
        b. Test the search function with some example IP addresses
        c. Free the memory used by the binary search tree using a post-order traversal.
